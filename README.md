# gpu_cluster
Boiler-plate framework for job scheduling on HPC GPU cluster.

This was a fun to program, as I have gained some experience with:
  - _template programming_ in C++
  - _CUDA programming_ on NVIDIA GPUs
  - _object serialization with Cereal library_ to prepare data for transmission
  - _OpenMPI transmission and synchronization_ for sending/receiving data
  - _PBS Pro scripting_ for job distribution on cluster
  - general _Object Oriented Programming_ concepts to not get lost on the way :D
